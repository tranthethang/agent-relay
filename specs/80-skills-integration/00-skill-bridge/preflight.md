Run `atry preflight --requires "<requires-atry>"` before any other command in this skill.
Stop when that command exits non-zero. A dev build needs `--allow-dev` or `ATRY_DEV=1`; do not use a dev build for a real run.
When `atry` reports an unknown command, stop and tell the user to update `atry` from the README of `github.com/tranthethang/agent-relay`.
When this skill names a run, call `atry context <run> --json` first.
Read `references/file-conventions.md` before you edit a run file.
When the context JSON has `run.worktree`, edit files and run git in `run.worktree.path`.
A claim result with `worktree.path` takes precedence over `run.worktree.path`.

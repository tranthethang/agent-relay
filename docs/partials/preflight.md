Run `atry version` before anything else in this stage. If it fails, stop —
do not search the filesystem for helpers and do not fall back to running
`scripts/atry`, `scripts/runtime/*.sh`, or `~/.agent-relay/lib/*.sh` directly.
Tell the user to run `verify.sh` and fix what it reports (most often
`$HOME/.local/bin` missing from `PATH`). Run `atry` from the repo root, and
confirm each `atry resolve` / `atry run-init` call below prints `atry: using
<path>` on stderr. Full rule: `references/file-conventions.md` ("atry
preflight").

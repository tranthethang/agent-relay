Run `atry version` before anything else in this skill. If it fails, stop.
Do not search the filesystem for helpers. Do not run `scripts/atry`,
`scripts/runtime/*.sh`, or `~/.agent-relay/lib/*.sh` directly.

Tell the user to run `verify.sh` and fix what it reports. The most common
cause is `$HOME/.local/bin` missing from `PATH`. Run `atry` from the repo
root. Confirm that each `atry resolve` and `atry run-init` call below prints
`atry: using <path>` on stderr. Full rule: `references/file-conventions.md`
("atry preflight").
